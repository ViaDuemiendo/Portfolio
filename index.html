            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>I currently live in  Calbayog City, Western Samar Philippines. I have always been amazed about how technology shapes our daily lives, and it has made me want to continue to explore and develop myself in the latest technology and take it even deeper and eager to understand the mechanics behind this course.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am an IT graduate who is passionate and determined about this field, and using this technology to help others and be innovative and overcome challenging issues. My goal is to continuously improve my knowledge about this field such as; cybersecurity, and software program improvement capabilities. So that I can work well in dynamic groups and create answers that will undoubtedly affect the process and grow knowledge in this field. I am committed to maintaining new technological features in the field, in addition to creating an engaging, pleasant work environment that encourages innovation in high standards </p>
            <br>
            <p>As a recent graduate in information technology, my path in this sector was influenced not only by the fact that I took this course but also to expand my knowledge of the life event that inspired me to do more passion and creativity. Because of my resourcefulness, modern technology grew up with minimal technological tools in a home with restricted access to contemporary technology. it gave me curiosity and to be interested and motivated to know how things work, so I started to investigate and extend programming languages and study the complexities of computer systems more thoroughly. <br>This technology affects real world situations and how important it is in our daily lives. Provides me for real protection and cybersecurity, which led to hope for special education and, training certifications in that area.</p>
